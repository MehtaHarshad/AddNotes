The text asserts that there are four important parts to medical practice – the patient, the physician, the nurse and the medicines.[10] All four are essential to recovery and return to health, states the text. The physician provides knowledge and coordinates the treatment, he is who can "explore the dark interior of the body with the lamp of knowledge", according to the text and Valiathan's translation.[10][36] The physician must express joy and cheer towards those who can respond to treatment, masterfully avoid and save time in cases where the patient suffers from incurable disease, while compassionate towards all.[10] The nurse must be knowledgeable, skilled at preparing formulations and dosage, sympathetic towards everyone and clean.[9] The patient is responsible for being positive, have the ability to describe how he or she feels, remember and respectfully follow the physician instructions.[9][10]

The Charaka Samhita, states Curtin, was among the earliest texts that set a code of ethics on physicians and nurses, attributing "moral as well as scientific authority to the healer".[37][38] The text, in chapters 8 and 9 of the Vimana Sthana dedicates numerous verses to discussing the code. It mandates that the physician must seek consent before entering a patient's quarters, must be accompanied by a male member of the family if he is attending a woman or minor, must inform and gain consent from patient or the guardians if the patient is a minor, must never resort to extortion for his service, never involve himself in any other activities with the patient or patient's family (such as negotiating loans, arranging marriage, buying or selling property), speak with soft words and never use cruel words, only do "what is calculated to do good to the patient", and maintain the patient's privacy.[39]
 that follow outline that discussions can be hostile or peaceful, the former are unproductive, the latter useful; even if one faces hostile criticism, one must persuade with gentle words and manner, asserts the text.[42]

Religious ideas
The Charaka Samhita, like many ancient Hindu literature, reveres and attributes Hindu gods as the ultimate source of its knowledge.[8] The Charaka Samhita mentions Bharadvaja learning from god Indra, after pleading that "poor health was disrupting the ability of human beings from pursuing their spiritual journey", and then Indra provides both the method and specifics of medical knowledge.[8][43] The method, asserts the text, revolves around three principles - etiology, symptomology and therapeutics.[8] Thus, states Glucklich, the text presumes proper goals to include both spiritual and physical health.[8]

The Charaka Samhita, in addition to initial recitations, uses the foundational assumptions and values embedded in various layers of the Vedas. These assumptions include the Vedic doctrine that a human being is a microcosmic replica of the universe,[8] and the ancient Hindu theory of six elements (five Prakriti and one Brahman),[8] three humors (Vata, Pitta, Kapha),[44] three Guṇas (Sattva, Rajas and Tamas) as constituent forces innate in a human body,[45] and others.[46] The Charaka Samhita is premised on the Hindu assumption that Atman (soul) exists, it is immutable, and thereafter the text defines physical and mental diseases as caused by a lack of correlation and imbalance in body, or mind, or both, because of external factors (Prakriti, objects of senses), age or a want of correlation (appropriate harmony, equilibrium) between the three humors or the three Gunas.[47]

The Sushruta Samhita and Caraka Samhita have religious ideas throughout, states Steven Engler, who then concludes "Vedic elements are too central to be discounted as marginal".[48][49][50] These ideas appear, for example, in the theoretical foundations and Vedic metaphors used in these texts.[48][49] In addition, states Engler, the text includes another layer of ideas, where empirical rational ideas flourish in competition or cooperation with religious ideas, as well as the evidence of later additions of some Brahminic ideas.[48]

There is a close relationship between the philosophic presuppositions and the approach to medicine in Charaka Samhita.[51][52]
